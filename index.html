                I’m a fullstack webdev that loves new technologies and making great applications using modern frameworks
                and clean UIs. When
                I'm not doing professional webdevelopment, I always have some of my own projects brewing.
                <br>In terms of technologies, I'm most experienced with Python (Django), RESTful design, and utilizing
                responsive design
                to bring
                a good user experience.
                <br>
                Most recently, I've been interested in Search Engine Optimization.

                <p>
                    I've used many different frameworks for developing various projects, preferring to use Python and
                    Django as the
                    backend for my own projects.
                    However I'm not afraid to learn new frameworks and ways of thinking.
                </p>

                <h4>Django</h4>
                <p>I've been using Django almost daily since 2013, both for professional work and for my own
                    hobbyprojects.
                    <br> Some of the more known Django frameworks that I've used:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>django-rest-framework</li>
                    <li>django-social-authentication</li>
                    <li>django-haystack</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    I've also worked with Flask as part of my work at iQ Payments, and am familiar with it's powers
                    and weaknesses.
                </p>

                <h4>Python</h4>

                <p>
                    As well as using both the Django and Flask frameworks, which are Python based, I've also used it
                    every day in my work at iQ Payments to add more functionality to the API and business logic.
                </p>

                <h4>PHP</h4>
                <p>
                    Although I'm not neccessarily a big fan of the language, I decidede to relearn it in 2020 because
                    of a personal need to add functionality to a forum I aquired a year earlier.<br>
                    After a couple weeks of fiddling I released the, now very popular,
                    <a href="https://xenforo.com/community/resources/categories/add-ons-2-x.44/?order=rating_weighted&direction=desc"
                       target="_blank">
                        Xenforo Forum addon: AMPXF
                    </a> which renders millions of AMP views across the world every day.
                </p>

                <h4>Angular (and AngularJS)</h4>
                <p>I Built a mobile application using Ionic, which was relying on AngularJS. <br>In 2017 I developed
                    iqtasks.com which was initially built with AngularJS and later upgraded to Angular by me.<br>
                    I also rewrote the webview part of iQ Payments whitelabel apps to be an SPA Angular app instead
                    of individual pages.
                </p>

                <h4>Svelte/SvelteKit</h4>
                <p>
                    Started a small project that I never finished, but very interested in their framework as it
                    was intuitive to use and solved things like Server Side Rendering in an effortless way.<br>
                    I'd love to build some real project with this framework.
                </p>

                <h4>VueJS</h4>
                <p>
                    Made a small personal project where the frontend handling was created with VueJS.<br>
                    By no means an expert, but I know the basic concepts :)
                </p>

                <h4>CSS frameworks I'm familiar with</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bootstrap 3, 4, 5</li>
                    <li>Semantic UI</li>
                    <li>Materialize</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>SEO and sitespeed optimizations</h4>

                <p>
                    Sitespeed is important for a successful webapp, where a user should be served content almost
                    instantly. Things such as optimizing
                    images and inlining important above-the-fold content is something often overlooked by developers,
                    that either
                    don't know about it or just don't care. <br> I've seen firsthand results of how improvement like
                    these can improve a sites appearance to the users and ultimately also the search engines.<br>
                    One example is when I decided to create the
                    <a href="https://ampxf.com/" target="_blank">AMPXF addon</a> so that my forum could grow faster.
                </p>

                <h4>SysAdmin / DevOps</h4>
                <p>
                    I've used the follwing cloud providers in my various projects: AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, Vultr. I'm
                    familiar with LAMP/LEMP stack as well as setting up backend services for most needs. things such as
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>docker & podman</li>
                    <li>nginx</li>
                    <li>gunicorn</li>
                    <li>pagespeed module for nginx</li>
                    <li>postgresql</li>
                    <li>redis</li>
                    <li>mongo</li>
                    <li>memcached</li>
                    <li>elasticsearch</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    plus many others. And if something new is needed I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty installing and
                    configuring it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Growing chilis and beans on my balcony with only water and airbubbles 😎. <br>

                    to 4~5 books a month, mainly in the non-fiction area to improve my skills and cultivate new

                    I have a pleasure to say that Jonathan has been a key developer at PayiQ. He has a broad full stack
                    skill set and he has worked as our lead developer for backend. He is quick and effective even with
                    complex tasks. Jonathan has been our key code reviewer and gatekeeper for pull requests. He has
                    successfully been growing his responsibilities into architectural design and devops as we have
                    enhanced our API's and have improved on our use of cloud services. He even has had the energy to dig
                    into customer support requests to solve any underlying software issues.

                    Jonathan provided key support for the afringa team during our initial setup phase and he implemented
                    several improvements
                    to our current state webservice. He added useful features according to specifications, with minimal
                    further clarifications
                    needed. Thanks to his knowledge with cloud providers (e.g. AWS) and backend systems (e.g. Django) we
                    were able
                    to cut afringa's server operating costs in half and he also helped us improve the site loading speed
                    significantly.
                    The quality of Jonathan's work was consistently exceeding our expectations and we would love to work
                    with him
                    soon again.

                    Jonathan is a goal-oriented developer, who can easily identify what’s needed from the project and
                    customer. His listening
                    skills allowed him to understand our customers needs and translate them into functional requirements
                    for our
                    other developers. <br> When Jonathan ran into a problem with the requirements he proactively brought
                    alternative solutions to the team for finding the best way forward.

                    I had the pleasure of working with Jonathan for close to two years. He's a efficient and meticulous
                    developer, keeping his
                    promised delivery dates and with a good eye for code quality.
